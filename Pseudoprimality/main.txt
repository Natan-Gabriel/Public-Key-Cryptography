By Fermat’s Little Theorem, if n is prime, then ∀b ∈ Z (enough
b < n) with (b, n) = 1 we have

b^(n−1) = 1 (mod n) (1)

An odd composite natural number n is called pseudoprime to the
base b if (b, n) = 1 and (1) holds.

Because ∀b ∈ Z with |b| ≥ 2, there are infinitely-many pseudoprimes to
the base b,we will find bases b from Zb

Input: b, k, n ∈ N with b < n and k =

Output: a = b
